<h1>SIEM Home Lab with Elastic Cloud Stack and Elastic Defend</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project used Elastic cloud stack to create a SIEM home lab that I used to demonstrate proficiency in SIEM configuration and management. Using this lab, I was able to simulate various security events, query for them, analyze, and alert on them with custom rules. Using these alerts, I developed a custom dashboard to visualize these events.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- <b>VirtualBox virtual machine with Kali Linux OS installed</b> 
- <b>Elastic stack with Elastic Defend integration</b>
